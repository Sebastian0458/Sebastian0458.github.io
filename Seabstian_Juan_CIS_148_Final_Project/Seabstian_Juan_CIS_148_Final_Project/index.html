            <p>My pet is a red-eared slider and his name us Torkoal. He is 3 years old,
                 and he is 4 inches long. When I first owned my pet turtle, he was really shy and did not want to eat. He was always uncomfortable trying to hide every time I tried to interact with it, but once he got comfortable, he kept playing around in the water. He is a friendly turtle greeting me every time I get close to his tank because he knows itâ€™s feeding time. I don't take him out of his tank often because sometimes he might feel distressed and might want to bite my hand, so I just take him out once a month just to hold him.  </p>
            <p>One thing about red-eared sliders they are active pets that enjoy swimming and diving all the time in the water. It is recommended to have a big tank so they can have enough space to swim and dive in the water whenever they want. It is fun taking care of a turtle because you get to learn alot more about taking care of it.  </p>
