          <p>One important thing about owning a turtle is knowing how to properly care for it. I will inform you on the main important things you will need in order to care for your turtle.  </p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="bolded"> Providing the right shelter:</span></li>
            <p>It is important to keep your turtle in a large tank so they can enjoy their home. Especially, for red-eared slider turtles they love swimming and diving so it is important to have enough room, and you won't have to keep upgrading your tank whenever your turtles keeps growing.  </p>
            <li><span class="bolded"> Cover bottom of tank with soil:</span></li>
            <p>For turtles not only do they need a wet environment, but also a dry area where they can relax. Having a basking area is great for your pet turtle to sit on.First, you will add the soil at the bottom of the tank, then you will add your basking area. When you found a perfect spot to place your basking area, you will make sure that it stays floating when you fill up then tank with water. </p>
            <li><span class="bolded">Water Maintenance </span>  </li>
            <p>Red-eared sliders are semi-aquatic animals, so most of their enclosure must be filled with water.Once you have filled your tank with water, you will need to add a filter. Having a filter is necessary to maintain a clean environment for your pet. It is recommended to buy a filter that has a high capacity. If you have a 20 gallon tank, then you should buy a filter that supports a tank double the size of what you own and has a high. GPH stands for “gallons per hour” and it refers to the flow rate of the filter. If you have a filter with 125 GPH has efficient filtration for aquariums up to 55 gallons, meaning if you have an aquarium less than 55 gallons it will keep the water clean.  </p>
            <li><span class="bolded">Lamp </span> </li>
            <p>Red-eared sliders require regular exposure to the sun in order to have good health. Installing a UVB and a heat lamp on your aquarium will provide all the vitamin D the body needs, which stimulates a better appetite and strengthens the immune system. The lights should be on for 14 hours/day during the summer and 10 hours/day during the winter. </p>
